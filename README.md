# U.S. Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes **60+ years of U.S. renewable energy consumption** data to uncover:
- Long-term trends in total renewable use
- Sector-level adoption patterns
- Shifts in the renewable energy mix (hydro, wind, solar, biomass)
- Year-over-year growth rates and best/worst expansion years

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- U.S. renewable consumption has steadily increased since 2005, driven by wind and solar.
- Hydroelectric remains steady but has lost dominance in the energy mix.
- Industrial and electric power sectors are the largest renewable consumers.
- Growth is volatile year to year but the **long-term trend is positive**.
